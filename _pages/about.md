I am a self-taught developer, Malware Analysis Enthusiast. Programming is my passion, which I found after creating my first program being very young. My fascination grew because of gaming, game hacking, and reverse engineering. My main interest now is on the IT-Security scene, particularly around (de)obfuscation, cryptography, and system penetration tests. Other hobbies include gaming, listening to (heavy!) music, and sports.
